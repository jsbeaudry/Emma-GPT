# Telegram OpenAI Integration

Welcome to the Telegram OpenAI Integration project! In this project, we leverage the power of OpenAI's technologies to enable anyone to use these advanced capabilities within the popular messaging platform, Telegram. With this integration, users can enjoy the benefits of OpenAI's cutting-edge technologies right from their Telegram conversations.

## Features

Once you have set up the integration and started the bot, you can begin using the OpenAI-powered features in your Telegram conversations. Here are a few examples:

- To chat with ChatGPT, simply send a text message to the bot, and it will respond with an AI-generated reply.
- To send voice messages and have them transcribed using OpenAI's Whisper model, send an audio message to the bot, and it will provide a textual representation of the audio.
- To generate images using OpenAI's DALLÂ·E model, send a description or prompt for the desired image to the bot, and it will reply with the generated image.

Feel free to explore, experiment the available features and add new ones!
